# Openonnect Installer
Installing and configuring a simple openconnect VPN server with *username* and *password* authentication.

This script works only on:
* **Ubuntu and it's derivatives**
* **Centos(RHEL) 7**

It should also work on recent versions of **Fedora** and it's derivatives but not tested.

Just run `ocinstaller.sh` and follow the instructions.
